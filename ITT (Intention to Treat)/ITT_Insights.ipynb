    "*Survival Curves by Cluster for Treated Patients*\n",
    "- The graph represents estimated survival rates over time for different K-Means clusters of treated patients.\n",
    "Each line corresponds to a cluster, showing how survival changes across the follow-up period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster-by-Cluster Analysis:\n",
    "Cluster 0- starts with the highest survival (~0.3) but shows a steep decline over time.\n",
    "This suggests that patients in this group initially have a good survival probability, but it drops quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1- begins at a lower survival probability (~0.12) and drops immediately to zero around the first follow-up time point.\n",
    "This indicates a high-risk group where nearly all patients fail to survive early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 2 -starts around 0.15 and remains almost flat until the last time point, where it slightly increases.\n",
    "This stability suggests moderate survival rates, potentially indicating a more resilient subgroup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 3-begins slightly below 0.25 and gradually increases over time.\n",
    "-is the most stable and even shows improvement, which could indicate effective treatment response or a different risk profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Heatmap Diagram*\n",
    "- This heatmap represents the distribution of treatment and outcomes across K-Means clusters. The values inside the cells indicate the proportion of patients in each cluster that fall into a specific treatment-outcome category. The color intensity corresponds to the proportions, with darker shades indicating higher values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Treatment is most effective in Cluster 1 & Cluster 2\"\n",
    "These clusters have the highest proportion of patients who received treatment and had a positive outcome (50% and 45%, respectively).\n",
    "They also have the lowest percentage of treated patients with negative outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Cluster 3-has a high natural survival rate\"\n",
    "Even without treatment, 42% of patients had a positive outcome (highest among all clusters).\n",
    "This suggests that patients in this group may have better baseline health, reducing the apparent benefit of treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Cluster 0 shows mixed treatment effects\"\n",
    "Similar proportions of positive outcomes between treated (30%) and untreated (33%) patients indicate unclear treatment benefits for this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Cluster 3 has the highest untreated negative outcome rate (16%)\"\n",
    "This means that without treatment, some patients in this group are more likely to have poor outcomes compared to other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Patient Clusters Based on Clinical and Treatment Features*\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph shows patient clusters based on clinical and treatment features using PCA. Different colors represent clusters, with centroids marked by white Xs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1 (Green) has the best outcomes (82%) and highest treatment adherence (57%).\n",
    "Cluster 2 (Purple) has the longest time on treatment but slightly lower outcomes (80%).\n",
    "Cluster 3 (Blue) has moderate success (73%).\n",
    "Cluster 0 (Red) has balanced but lower overall stats.\n",
    "\n",
    " Note: Longer treatment doesn't guarantee better outcomes, and younger patients (Cluster 1) seem to respond best.\n",
