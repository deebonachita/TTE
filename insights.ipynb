    "Target Trial Emulation (TTE) is a method used in observational studies to estimate causal effects by mimicking a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Since actual RCTs may not always be feasible due to ethical, logistical, or financial constraints, TTE allows researchers to analyze observational data in a way that approximates the conditions of a well-designed trial."

    "### How does it work?\n",
    "1. #### Define the estimand\n",
    "   - Specify the causal question being addressed (e.g., intention-to-treat (ITT) or      per-protocol (PP)).\n",
    "   - Identify the treatment assignment strategy.\n",
    "2. #### Prepare Observational Data\n",
    "   - Structure the data similarly to an RCT by including necessary variables like        treatment assignment, outcomes, eligibility, and censoring information.\n",
    "3. #### Handle Censoring and Treatment Switching\n",
    "   - Observational data may have informative censoring (e.g., patients drop out due      to health changes) or treatment switching (e.g., patients switching to another      treatment).\n",
    "   - Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW) are used to adjust for biases       introduced by these issues.\n",
    "4. #### Expand the Observational Dataset into Trial Sequences\n",
    "   - The data is transformed into a sequence of trials where individuals enter at        different times, ensuring comparisons between treatment groups remain valid.\n",
    "5. #### Fit a Marginal Structural Model (MSM)\n",
    "   - An MSM is used to estimate causal effects while accounting for time-dependent       confounding.\n",
    "6. #### Generate Predictions & Visualizations\n",
    "   - Compute survival probabilities and cumulative incidences under different            treatment scenarios.\n",
    "   - Use plots to compare treatment effects over time."
